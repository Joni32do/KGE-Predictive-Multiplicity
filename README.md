# Predictive Multiplicity for Classification and KGE

Content for the lecture "Machine Learning for Knowledge Graph Embeddings" during the wintersemester 2024/2025 by Prof. Stefan Staab.

## Abstract

Predictive multiplicity is a phenomenon that occurs for predictions in classification and knowledge graph embeddings (KGE). Different measures of predictive multiplicity are defined that estimate how similar predictions are from competing models. Through illustrative examples, the extension of PM from classification to KGE is guided.
